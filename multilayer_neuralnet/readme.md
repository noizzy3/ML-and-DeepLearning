This is a digit recognition code with multilayer neural nets.
Following are the input format:-
1. Open the python terminal
2. load love
3. var=love.network([784,30,10],30,10,3.0)

or you can directly run the code and call the network function inside

Here the first parameter is an array of number of neurons in each layer including input and output.
subsequently we have epochs,size of minibatch and then finally the learning rate

# This is a numpy implementation of a multilayer neural net.
### To run the code-
* Open the python interpreter
* load mlp
* mlp.network([784,30,10],30,10,3.0)

### Here the first parameter is an array of number of neurons in each layer including input and output, subsequently we have epochs,size of minibatch and then finally the learning rate
